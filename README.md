# [**together.ai**](https://www.together.ai/) ðŸ¤–

- A platform focused on making large, powerful AI models (like LLaMA) more accessible and easier to use.
- Especially for those working in the field of Generative AI (GenAI), R&D, and business to leverage its capabilities.
- They provide the infrastructure, tools, and models to make GenAI more accessible.
- Overall, Together.ai helps bridge the gap between powerful AI models and practical applications.

**What Together.ai Does:**

1. **Cloud for GenAI**: 
- They provide a cloud platform specifically designed for running and experimenting with LLMs.
- This eliminates the need for individual users to have powerful hardware, making these models more accessible.

2. **Focus on Open Source**: 
- Together.ai focuses on using and supporting leading open-source models.
- This allows for wider collaboration and development in the AI community. 

3. **Easy Inference and Fine-tuning**: 
- Their platform allows users to easily run these models on their data (inference) and even fine-tune them for specific tasks.
- Fine-tuning allows you to specialize a model for a particular use case.

4. **Scalable Deployments**: 
- They offer features for deploying AI applications built with these models at scale.
- This means you can take your project from experimentation to real-world use. 

### **Example: Analyzing Customer Reviews**
An e-commerce store wants to analyze customer reviews to understand what people like and dislike about your products. 
1. **Choose a Model:** You could choose a sentiment analysis model from Together.ai's library, like a pre-trained LLaMA model.
2. **Upload Data:** You upload your customer reviews to Together.ai's platform.
3. **Inference:** You run the model on your data. Together.ai would analyze each review and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. 
4. **Analyze Results:** You can then analyze the results to see which aspects of your products receive positive or negative feedback.
